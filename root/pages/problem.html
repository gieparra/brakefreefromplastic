        <h1>The Problem: A Plastic Crisis</h1>
        <p>Plastic has transformed the way we live—it's cheap, convenient, and versatile. But this convenience comes at a cost. Over the last century, plastic waste has grown into a global crisis, polluting our planet and threatening ecosystems, wildlife, and even human health.</p>

        <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mass Production:</strong> Plastic became a staple in industries worldwide starting in the mid-20th century. With its durability and affordability, production soared. Unfortunately, so did waste. The world produces over 400 million metric tons of plastic annually—double the amount produced at the beginning of the century.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Biodegradable Nature:</strong> Unlike organic materials, plastic doesn’t decompose; it breaks into smaller pieces called microplastics that persist in the environment for centuries. Each year, an estimated 11 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean, joining the 200 million metric tons already polluting marine ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Overuse:</strong> From packaging to single-use items like straws, bottles, and bags, the global reliance on plastic has created mountains of waste. Shockingly, up to 50% of all plastic produced is for single-use purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../images/ocean_plastic_pollution.svg" alt="">

        <p>These staggering figures highlight how unsustainable our reliance on plastic has become, impacting both the environment and public health.</p>

        <h2>The Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>Plastic waste is not biodegradable. Instead, it breaks down into tiny fragments called microplastics that contaminate water, soil, and air. Marine life often mistakes plastic for food, leading to injury or death. Entire ecosystems are at risk as ocean pollution grows, with scientists predicting more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050 if no action is taken.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ocean Pollution:</strong> Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the oceans. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a massive collection of floating debris, is a haunting example of this crisis.</li>
            <li><strong>Harm to Marine Life:</strong> Sea turtles, birds, and fish mistake plastic for food, often leading to injury, starvation, or death. Microplastics are even found in plankton, the base of the marine food chain.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Effects:</strong> The production and disposal of plastic release greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Plastic pollution doesn’t just hurt the environment—it’s also a growing threat to human health.</p>
        <h2>Microplastics in Our Lives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In Food and Water: </strong> Microplastics have infiltrated our food chain, appearing in seafood, salt, and even drinking water.</li>
            <li><strong>In the Air:</strong> Plastic particles are also present in the air we breathe, entering our bodies unknowingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Toxic Chemical Exposure</h2>
        <p>The chemicals used in producing and breaking down plastic are highly toxic. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hormone Disruptors: </strong>Chemicals like BPA can interfere with human hormonal systems, potentially causing reproductive and developmental issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Carcinogens:</strong> Certain compounds in plastics have been linked to cancer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
        <p>Burning plastic waste releases dangerous pollutants, contributing to respiratory diseases and worsening air quality. The accumulation of these toxins poses long-term risks to public health.</p>
        <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
        <p>Understanding the problem and its health implications is the first step toward change. Together, we can reduce plastic consumption, support innovations, and advocate for stricter policies to combat plastic pollution.</p>
